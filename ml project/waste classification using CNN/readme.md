Waste Image Classification

Overview

This project focuses on waste classification using image processing and machine learning. It utilizes a Jupyter Notebook to analyze and categorize waste images into different types, helping in proper waste disposal and recycling efforts.

Features

Image preprocessing and augmentation

Machine learning model for waste classification

Evaluation metrics to assess model performance

Visualization of classification results

Requirements

To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn opencv-python

Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>

Navigate to the project directory:

cd waste-image-classification

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook waste_image.ipynb

Run the notebook cells sequentially to train and test the model.

Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing consists of images of different waste materials, categorized into classes such as organic, recyclable, and non-recyclable waste.

Model

The project employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification. The model is trained to recognize and differentiate various waste types based on image features.

Results

Accuracy: Achieved accuracy based on dataset and training parameters

Confusion matrix and classification report for performance evaluation

Future Enhancements

Improve model accuracy with more training data

Implement real-time waste classification

Develop a web or mobile application for user-friendly classification
